 * Projects, officer-authored.

 *
 * It was the one officer-facing table that was pushed: the platform owned the
 * rows and Airtable held a read-only mirror. Nothing in the platform could
 * create one. There was no console page, no server action and no seed, RLS
 * denies every client write, and the only inserts anywhere in the repo were
 * test fixtures — while `pullWorkshops` refused to create a workshop whose
 * Project link did not resolve. An officer doing the obvious thing, typing a
 * project name into Airtable's link picker, produced a Projects row with no
 * `⚙️ Platform ID`; `projectIdMap` accepted only rows carrying one, so the
 * link was unresolvable, and it stayed unresolvable on every pass forever
 * because no amount of waiting issues an id to a row the platform never made.
 * Their workshop simply never appeared.
 *
 * Pulling it removes the failure instead of reporting it. The Project link now
 * resolves through the pull's idMap exactly like the Meeting link beside it,
 * and `pushProjects` and `projectIdMap` are both gone.
 *
 * `⚙️ Slug` is gone with them. The slug is derived once on insert from the
 * name and never recomputed — the rule `meetings.slug` follows, and sharper
 * here, because `stars.csv` is keyed on it across semesters and regenerating
 * it on a rename would rewrite an export somebody already has. A column
 * showing officers a value they cannot edit and must not rely on was worth
 * less than the confusion it invited.
 *
 * `⚙️ Platform ID` stays, pushed and the match key, because `applyPull` reads

/**
 * Attendance, the one table Airtable CREATES rows in.
 *
 * Every other table here is either platform-owned and pushed, or
 * officer-authored and pulled field by field. This one is different in kind: a
 * row appears because somebody filled in a form in a workshop, or because a
 * co-branded event's roster was pasted in from whatever the other club uses.
 * The platform never writes a record here, only reads them and reports back.
 *
 * ## Why a MyID and not an email field
 *
 * `MyID` is the local part alone: `jdoe`, not `jdoe@uga.edu`. Two reasons, and
 * the second is the load-bearing one:
 *
 *   * It is what somebody standing in a workshop can type without thinking,
 *     which matters when the alternative is a wrong address.
 *   * An `email`-typed field cannot be a `.matchKey()`, since
 *     `fieldsToMergeOn` rejects the type outright. More importantly, accepting
 *     a free-text address would let a response name `someone@gmail.com`.
 *     Sign-in is Google restricted to `hd=uga.edu`, so an address outside that
 *     domain can never be claimed by anybody and would create an account
 *     nobody can reach. Taking the local part and appending the domain
 *     ourselves makes that unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * ## What the platform writes back
 *
 * Only `⚙️ Platform ID` and `⚙️ Sync status`. The first is the imported row's
 * uuid, which makes a re-import idempotent and shows an officer that a
 * response landed. The second carries the refusal when it did not: an unknown
 * MyID, a link the platform cannot resolve, or a Meeting and a Workshop that
 * name different nights.
