 * answer, and someone whose stack was already up had no way to stop it at all,
 * because "stop" was not in the tree. Both are the same bug. The menu
 * described the CLI rather than the situation.
 *
 * So this reads three facts and `menu.ts` adapts to them. The facts are few
 * and cheap on purpose; see `probeEnvironment` for the budget and why.
 *
 * ## Unknown is not "no"
 *
 * Every probe can come back `"unknown"`, and that is what a failed probe
 * reports rather than guessing. Nothing is hidden or flagged on `"unknown"`: a
 * machine this cannot read gets the full menu, exactly as before. A tool that
 * hides a command because a `docker ps` timed out is worse than one that never
 * adapted at all, because the command it hides is the one you were looking
