 * Those are two axes and this file owns one of them; `@devdogsuga/og`'s
 * `formats.ts` owns the other. Keeping them apart is the point: an event poster
 * for the GDG on Campus platform is the pairing "this meeting" x "that
 * platform's banner", and while they were one flat list of hard-coded
 * (content, size) targets, no such pairing could be asked for — only the ones
 * somebody had already written down existed.
 *
 * The matrix is SPARSE, and each graphic declares its own column of it. Every
 * graphic supports the two GDG renditions, because anything the club makes may
 * end up on that platform. Beyond that: `savvycal` is one cover on one
 * scheduling page and belongs to the club lockup alone, the email densities
 * belong to the lockup too, and the icon sizes belong to the apps.
