/**
 * `pnpm devtools [command] [--local | --remote | --team <slug>]`
 *
 * Run it with no arguments and it opens a menu. That is the point: a
 * contributor should be able to set up a database and check their moderation
 * integration without knowing a single command name, and without reading this
 * file first.
 *
 * The subcommands still exist for anyone who does know them, and for CI, which
 * cannot answer a prompt.
 *
 * ## Three files, one tree
 *
 * `commands.ts` holds the command tree as data. `help.ts` renders one level of
 * it at a time, and `menu.ts` walks it into an argv that comes back through
 * `dispatch()` below, the same entry a typed command line takes. That is why
 * the menu covers everything the CLI does: there is no second list of commands
 * anywhere, so there is nothing to fall out of step.

 *
 * The first SIX were files in `scripts/` that imported devtools' own sources
 * through a relative path, which is why `scripts/` needed a tsconfig and a CI
 * typecheck step of its own. They are devtools commands now, and get the
 * documentation, refusals and named errors the rest of the CLI has. The two
 * Airtable steps were never in `scripts/`: they are new work, filling the
 * §3.5 gap the deploy workflow used to describe in a comment.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Dispatched BEFORE `intro()`, and it never calls `outro()`
 *
 * Every `@clack/prompts` writer writes to STDOUT: `intro`, `outro`, `log.*`,
 * `note`, the spinner (measured; see `deploy/report.ts`). Two commands
 * in this group have a stdout something downstream parses: `secrets-file`
 * emits `::add-mask::<token>`, which GitHub recognises only on a line of its
 * own, and `mint-token` emits a signed JWT that its caller takes whole. A
 * banner on that stream is not cosmetic. It is an unmasked production
 * credential in a public repository's job log, or a Worker secret with a box
 * drawing character in it.
 *
 * So: no `intro`, no `outro`, and nothing in `deploy/` may use `log`, `note`
 * or `explain`. Failures render through `say()`, which is stderr.
 *
 * Nothing here prompts either. There is nobody to ask on a runner, and a
