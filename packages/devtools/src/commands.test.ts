/**
 * The command tree's own invariants, and the coverage claim that rests on it.
 *
 * The claim: **the wizard reaches every command and every option the CLI
 * has.** It holds because one declaration, `commands.ts`, is what the menu
 * walks, `--help` renders, and every dispatcher in `cli.ts` validates against.
 * This file guards the parts of that which a type cannot: that the names match
 * the ones dispatch actually accepts, that nothing is declared twice, and that
 * a summary stays the one line `--help` prints it as.
 *
 * `cli.ts` is deliberately NOT imported here, because importing it runs
 * `main()`. The names it dispatches on that are not derived from the tree are
 * the two exported tuples below plus a small hand-list, checked against the
 * tree.
