/**
 * Brand image templates, rendered by two different callers.
 *
 * `apps/platform` renders them through `next/og` for Open Graph cards, and
 * `@devdogsuga/devtools` renders them through Satori directly to write files on
 * disk. Nothing here imports a renderer, which is what lets both work: the
 * platform must use Next's own compiled copy of `@vercel/og` (the one
 * `@opennextjs/cloudflare` patches on the way to a Worker), while the CLI needs
 * a build that runs under plain Node. The templates are the shared half.
 *
 * A template takes its own `width` and `height` rather than assuming one size.
 * The same card is asked for at a link unfurl's 1.91:1, the GDG platform's
 * 2560x650 banner and its 1080x1080 square, and `CardShell` lays each out
 * differently — see `formats.ts` for the renditions and `CardShell` for the
 * three shapes.
 *
 * Consumed BUILT, unlike `@devdogsuga/env` — there is no `devdogs-source`
 * export condition here on purpose. These are `.tsx`, and the source condition
 * hands raw TypeScript to whichever loader the importer is using; tsx picks its
 * JSX setting from a single tsconfig near the CWD, so `devtools` (whose CWD is
 * its own package) compiled these templates with the classic runtime and every
 * render failed with `React is not defined`. `dist` is compiled once, here,
 * with this package's own `jsx: react-jsx`, and no consumer has to agree.
 *
 * The cost is that editing a template means `pnpm --filter @devdogsuga/og build`
 * before the CLI sees it. Turbo's `^build` covers CI and every `pnpm build`.
 *
 * `@devdogsuga/og/event` is a SEPARATE entry point and deliberately so: it
 * holds the club's timezone and the meeting-to-card formatting, and importing
 * it must not drag this module's few hundred kilobytes of embedded fonts along.
