/**
 * The sizes a graphic can be rendered at, and what wants each one.
 *
 * A **format** is a rendition; a **graphic** is a subject. They are two axes,
 * and keeping them apart is what lets "the September 8 meeting" and "the GDG
 * chapter banner size" be asked for independently — which is the whole point,
 * because an event poster for the GDG platform is exactly that pairing and
 * nothing enumerated it before.
 *
 * Not every pairing exists. `savvycal` is one cover on one scheduling page and
 * belongs to the club lockup alone; an app icon has no meaning at 2560x650.
 * Each graphic declares the formats it supports, and the CLI's registry is
 * where that lives — this file only says how big each rendition is.
