/**
 * Turning a meeting row into the strings an event card draws.
 *
 * ## Why this is its own entry point
 *
 * Two callers need it and neither can reach the other's copy: the platform
 * renders event cards per request from `opengraph-image.tsx`, and
 * `devtools images` renders them to disk from a database query. The formatting
 * has to be shared, because "what time is the meeting" is the one question
 * these images exist to answer and two implementations is two answers.
 *
 * It is exported as `@devdogsuga/og/event` rather than from the package index,
 * and that separation is load-bearing. The index pulls in the embedded fonts
 * and brand artwork — a few hundred kilobytes of base64. `EVENT_TZ` is imported
 * by `lib/meetingTitle.ts`, which is explicitly safe for a client component to
 * import, so routing it through the index would put the whole font payload one
 * careless bundler decision away from the browser. Nothing in this file imports
 * anything.
 */

/**
 * The club's timezone, and the ONLY definition of it.
 *
 * `apps/platform/src/lib/eventTime.ts` re-exports this rather than declaring
 * its own. Every formatter in the app already routes through that module for
 * the reason its own comments give: a caller that formats a meeting time
 * without the zone renders whatever the server happens to be set to, and gets
 * it wrong by an hour twice a year without anything failing.
