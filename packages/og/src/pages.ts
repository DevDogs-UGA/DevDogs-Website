/**
 * The Open Graph copy for every page that has a fixed one.
 *
 * Keyed by route, and the set of keys is not arbitrary: it is exactly the
 * static half of `apps/platform/src/app/sitemap.ts`. That file is already the
 * club's answer to "which URLs are public", worked out against auth guards and
 * `robots: { index: false }` — the console, the account page, the ballots and
 * the team rosters are all absent from it because none of them is a page a
 * stranger can open. Deriving this list from the same place is what makes
 * "every page except the access-gated ones" a rule rather than a list somebody
 * has to remember to update. `pages.test.ts` asserts the two stay equal.
 *
 * Pages whose copy depends on a database row — a meeting, a competition's
 * results, a docs page — are not here. They build their card from the record
 * in their own `opengraph-image.tsx`.
