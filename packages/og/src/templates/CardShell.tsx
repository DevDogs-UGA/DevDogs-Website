/**
 * The frame every card shares: club lockup, a section chip, the page's own
 * content, and the club's address along the bottom.
 *
 * Link previews and event banners are read in a scroll, at a size where the
 * picture registers before any of the words do. So the parts that say "this is
 * DevDogs" are fixed and identical on every card, and only the middle changes.
 *
 * ## Three layouts, not one that stretches
 *
 * The same card is asked for at 1.91:1 (a link unfurl), 3.94:1 (the GDG
 * platform's banner) and 1:1 (its square). Those are not one picture at three
 * sizes — 2560x650 has a column of horizontal room and almost no height, and
 * 1080x1080 the reverse. Stretching one layout across them puts a two-line
 * title through a 650px-tall frame with no room for the detail underneath.
 *
 * So `wide` turns the card on its side: the lockup and the chip take a left
 * column, the content takes the rest. `square` and `standard` stack, with
 * square given the larger type its extra height affords. Everything scales off
 * `u`, so a size is written once and holds at every canvas.
