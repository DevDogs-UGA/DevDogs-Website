/**
 * One app's icon: its mark, on its colour, with the border and block shadow
 * the rest of the site is drawn with.
 *
 * Everything scales off `size`, so 32 and 1024 are the same artwork rather than
 * two drawings. The proportions are fixed as fractions of the canvas, which is
 * what keeps a favicon recognisable as the same object as the 512px PWA icon
 * beside it.
 *
 * Below roughly 48px the border and shadow are a pixel each and stop reading as
 * separate shapes — the icon degrades into a coloured rounded square with a
 * mark on it, which is the right thing for it to degrade into. It is drawn
 * rather than skipped so a 32px favicon and a 512px icon are never two
 * different marks.
