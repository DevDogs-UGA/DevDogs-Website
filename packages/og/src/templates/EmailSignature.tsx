/**
 * The lockup that goes at the foot of an email.
 *
 * A signature is the one surface here that is not the club's own, and it is
 * constrained by clients rather than by design:
 *
 *   - PNG, never SVG. Gmail and every Outlook strip `<img>` sources they do not
 *     recognise, and a signature that renders as a broken-image icon is worse
 *     than no signature.
 *   - The ground is painted, not left transparent. A transparent PNG inherits
 *     whatever the client puts behind it, and the dark-mode clients that
 *     inverted the body would leave the mascot's near-black outlines on
 *     near-black.
 *   - Wide and short. It sits beside or beneath a block of contact text, and
 *     anything taller than about a third of its width pushes that text off the
 *     first screen on a phone.
 *
 * Aspect is fixed at {@link EMAIL_SIGNATURE_ASPECT} so the same artwork exports
 * at 1x, 2x and 3x and a client can set the 1x dimensions on the `<img>`.
