/**
 * The club banner: mascot, wordmark, GDG chapter cobrand, and how to find us.
 *
 * One component covers every banner slot the club fills — a 2560x650 chapter
 * header, a 1500x500 scheduling page, a 1080x1080 profile tile — because they
 * differ in two ways only, and both are derived rather than authored: the
 * layout turns from a row into a column below {@link COLUMN_BELOW}, and every
 * measurement scales off the canvas. Authoring one file per slot would mean a
 * brand change landing in some of them.
 *
 * Sizes are written against a 500-tall reference and multiplied by `u`, so the
 * 2560x650 cut is the 1500x500 one at 1.3x rather than a second set of numbers
 * that drifts from the first.
