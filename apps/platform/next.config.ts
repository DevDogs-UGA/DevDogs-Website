  // NOT `cacheComponents: true`, deliberately, since 2026-08-20: Cache
  // Components' partial prerendering is broken on the OpenNext Cloudflare
  // adapter. Upstream's symptom is cached shells served without dynamic
  // streaming (opennextjs-cloudflare#1115); ours was worse. Every `◐` route
  // hung in workerd until the runtime killed the request ("hung and would
  // never generate a response"), while route handlers, middleware and the
  // database all worked. `experimental.useCache` keeps the `"use cache"` +
  // `cacheLife` directives (DocsMarkdown and friends) compiling and caching;
  // only the PPR machinery is off. Revisit when the adapter supports it.
  //
  // ⚠️ `experimental.useCache` prints "is deprecated. Please use the
  // top-level `cacheComponents` option instead". Read next's own config.js
  // (search `E1465`) before "fixing" that: `cacheComponents` is a plain
  // boolean with no partial mode, and setting it ALSO flips
  // `experimental.ppr = true` internally. This deprecated flag is the only way
  // to get `"use cache"` without PPR.
