 * information, not decoration.
 *
 * Two dialects, one meaning. The homepage section sits on the marketing
 * pages' light plates, so its chips are solid fills with black borders. The
 * /events page uses the console dialect, dark mauve with translucent tinted
 * chips, so every badge carries a `*Dark` variant beside the light one. The
 * HUE never changes between the two: a judging night is rose on both plates,
 * or the colour stops being information.

 * Nothing in this module reads the clock or the database, so it is safe to

//
// ⚠️ The loaders deliberately do NOT filter cancelled rows. `getMeetingsInRange`
// and `getPastMeetings` keep them (see the note in `loaders/meetings.ts`), and
// only `getUpcomingMeetings` drops them, because the schedule keeps a cancelled
// night for the people who were already told to turn up. So EVERY consumer of
// those two loaders is responsible for the gate, and four silently were not:
// the calendar dot and its popover, the past-meetings archive, the dialog
// header, whose title and time are also the Radix accessible name and
// description, so a screen-reader user was told only when and where, and
// `generateMetadata`, so the Discord unfurl of the link people were sent still
// advertised the room and the hour.
//
// The predicate was also re-derived as `meeting.cancelledAt !== null` at each
// site that did remember, which is how the count got to four: there was nothing
// to import, so nothing to notice the absence of.
