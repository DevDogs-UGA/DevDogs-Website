 * The events page, in the console dialect. It puts the gated pages' dark mauve

 * one `ConsoleCard`. It is the one public page drawn this way, so a member who
 * signs in does not step between two visual worlds to get from "when do we
 * meet" to "check my streak".
 *
 * ONE card, because this page is a schedule and nothing else: every meeting on
 * the books, coming and gone, with the calendar beside it. The next one is the
 * first row rather than a band of its own saying the same thing bigger.
 *
 * `HowItWorks` used to sit under it explaining the chips and has moved to the
 * homepage, where somebody asking "what happens if I turn up" already is. A
 * header link replaces it, so there is no second, shorter explanation to keep
 * in step by hand. The calendar's legend still names every colour on the grid.
 *
 * The room is not named up here. Every row says its own, and the ones in the
 * usual room say nothing, which is how a room change stands out.
 *
 * The accent is cyan because cyan is the kickoff chip's hue in `meetingView`,
 * the start of a sprint, which is what this page is mostly a list of.
 *
 * Every band is presentational and takes data as props. `now` and `today` are
 * resolved once by the layout so the rows and the calendar cannot disagree
 * about what day it is.
