 * Not a service worker and no offline story. Nothing here makes the app
 * installable in the PWA sense. What a browser reads whether or not an app is
 * installed is the name under a pinned tile, the colour of the Android address
 * bar, and a `<link rel="manifest">` that search engines and share sheets read
 * as a signal of a real site rather than a page.
 *
 * The name and description repeat the two strings `app/layout.tsx` exports as
 * `title` and `description`. They are written out rather than imported because
 * importing the root layout's `metadata` here would make a metadata route
 * depend on a layout module. Keep the three in step.

     * `@devdogsuga/og`. So the two Chrome wants are declared here, and the app

     * to keep its content inside the middle 80% so a launcher can crop it to
     * whatever shape it likes, and this mark spends its outer edge on the
     * border and the block shadow that make it look like the rest of the site.
     * Declaring it maskable would let Android crop those off.
