 * /events/[slug], one meeting, as the body of the dialog its layout opens.
 *
 * The STRUCTURE here is derived and stays that way: the segments come from
 * `resolveMeetingSegments` and the agenda from the workshops and judging
 * attached to the meeting. Nothing restates in prose what the schedule already
 * knows, because that copy goes stale the moment the schedule moves and this
 * URL exists to be pasted into Discord weeks in advance.
 *
 * Three authored fields are allowed through, separated from the rule above by
 * what they are ABOUT. `summary` and `nameOverride` describe the night, so
 * they are timing-shaped and held to one or two sentences an officer rewrites
 * when the night changes. `workshops.description` describes what a session
 * TEACHES, which does not move when the calendar does: a Supabase workshop
 * covers the same ground whichever Monday it lands on. It earns its place
 * because "this is self-contained and assumes no prior work" is the most
 * useful thing a prospective member can read here, and no derived structure
 * can say it.
