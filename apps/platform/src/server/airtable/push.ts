/**

 * exclusively, and never create a field both sides write.** A field with two
 * writers has no way to resolve a conflict, and last-writer-wins destroys
 * somebody's work silently, weeks later.
 *
 * Which write verb each table gets follows from who authors it, not from
 * convenience:
 *
 *   * Members, Projects, Teams: the platform authors these, so a row with no
 *     Airtable record should create one. Upsert on `⚙️ Platform ID`.
 *   * Meetings, Workshops, Competitions: Airtable authors these. The platform
 *     only writes derived values onto rows that already exist, addressed by
 *     record id. Upserting them would create a duplicate record for every row
 *     whose Platform ID is still blank.
