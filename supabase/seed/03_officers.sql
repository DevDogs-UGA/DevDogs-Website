-- The 2026-27 executive board.
--
-- Content, so it lives with the content. The schema this needs --
-- `roleDescription` widened to 512, and the academic program tables --
-- is 20260829010000_01_platform_profile.sql, and it has to be: a
-- migration is the only thing that reaches a database nobody is allowed to
-- drop. The seven people are a different kind of fact, and a file called
-- `03_officers.sql` says what it holds in a way a timestamped migration
-- cannot.
--
-- Seeds run on `supabase db reset` only, never on `db push` -- config.toml
-- says so where it opens the development-only gate, and 02_moderation.sql
-- leans on it. The board's plan is to reset before pushing to production,
-- which is what makes this the delivery path rather than a local fixture.
--
-- A reset erases the database. That is fine now, before launch, and it stops
-- being fine the moment production carries attendance, ballots or teams that
-- cannot be dropped. After that point an edit here reaches contributors and nothing
-- else, and the officers' own content is maintained where they already
-- maintain it -- `roleDescription` and links from /account, titles and role
-- assignments from the console -- with a one-off migration for anything that
-- has to be corrected centrally.
--
-- Seeds run after migrations on a reset, so the columns below always exist by
-- the time this runs. Filename order puts it after 01_roles.sql, which is
-- what guarantees the Member and Root definitions are already there.
--
-- ============================================================
-- Filling gaps, never overwriting
-- ============================================================
--
-- Every write below is a gap-fill: `coalesce` for scalars,
-- `on conflict do nothing` for the academic selections and links, and the
-- same pattern for the rest. An officer who has already written their own role description, set
-- their own graduation year or picked their own preferred name keeps every bit
-- of it. That matters more than it looks -- these submissions were emailed in
-- July, `roleDescription` is editable from /account, and the account is the
-- newer source. It is also what makes the file safe to replay, which a reset
-- does every time.
--
-- ============================================================
-- The bios
-- ============================================================
--
-- Third person throughout, and condensed to fit varchar(512) -- the submitted
-- text ran 448 to 959 characters. Nothing is invented and no claim is added;
-- where a sentence was cut it was cut whole. The full submitted text, in each
-- officer's original wording, is the copy of record in the private archive
-- alongside their resumes and the original emails.
--
-- Pronouns are recorded for every officer, and where they came from matters,
-- because for most of the board there was nothing to find.
--
-- Armani Peacox's came from her own bio, which is the only one submitted in
-- the third person and says "She serves as the Campus Coordinator". The other
-- seven were supplied by the president, who knows them. Nothing here was
-- inferred from a name: no resume states pronouns, no other submitted bio uses
-- them, and the public GitHub profiles for nandanpraveen, kquakk and
-- smcodes612 list none, nor does zayan.hoodani.me. That search came up empty,
-- which is why asking was the route that worked.
--
-- The bios follow. They were written in the third person with they/them
-- standing in wherever a pronoun was unavoidable, explicitly pending this
-- answer; each of those now reads as the officer's own. Gabrielle's and
-- Sloan's use no pronoun at all and were left as written.
--
-- `profile.pronouns` is editable from /account, which is where a correction
-- belongs -- these are second-hand, however well sourced, and the person is
-- the only authority on them.
--
-- ============================================================
-- Graduation dates
-- ============================================================
--
-- Read off each officer's resume in the private archive rather than guessed
-- from "sophomore", which is what the bios say and which does not pin a year.
-- Every one reads "May 20xx", so every semester below is 'spring'.
--
-- Two carry a caveat:
--
--   * Jack Harrington's resume lists a BS in May 2027 AND an MS in May 2028.
--     2027 is recorded, being the degree he is currently enrolled for, but the
--     field's stated purpose on /account is verifying student status -- and by
--     that reading 2028 is the truer answer. His to settle.
--   * Armani Peacox's resume gives a start (08/2025) and no expected end, so
--     hers stays null. Four years from a 2025 start would be a guess, and this
--     column feeds `profileWithVerification`.
--
-- Setting both halves matters beyond the card: `hasGraduationDate` in
-- `profileWithVerification` requires the semester AND the year, so these rows
-- move each officer a step toward verified.
--
-- ============================================================
-- Accounts, and the hazard in creating them
-- ============================================================
--
-- Officers are matched to `auth.users` case-insensitively, and one is created
-- where there is no such user. A
-- created row has no password and no `auth.identities` row, so it cannot sign
-- in -- it is a container holding submitted content until the person arrives.
-- The ids are in the same literal space as the moderation personas
-- (00000000-0000-4000-a000-...), one block along, so the two seeds cannot
-- collide.
--
-- Every officer is matched on their UGA MyID address -- the initials-plus-digits
-- form, supplied by the president -- because sign-in is UGA SSO and that is
-- the address the account will carry. Three officers submitted from personal
-- Gmail and two more from a uga.edu alias rather than the MyID; each of those
-- is kept in "altEmails" so a match still lands if an account was made under
-- one of them.
--
-- That closes the orphaning hazard this file used to carry, with one case
-- left. If an officer signs in under an address on neither list, GoTrue mints a NEW user and the profile seeded here is stranded --
-- the card keeps the seeded content while the real account has none. Adding an
-- address here before a reset is cheap; merging two users afterwards is not.

  -- Other addresses the same person may have signed in under. Matching checks
  -- these too, which is the cheapest defence against attaching a profile to
  -- the wrong account -- a mistake only discovered when somebody notices their

  -- are set because the intent is recorded now, and whoever wires the display
  -- should not have to re-derive who consented.
  --
  -- Applied on INSERT ONLY, like "preferredName" and for a sharper reason:
  -- these are consent, and the column is `not null default false`, so a false
  -- read cannot tell "never set" from "deliberately switched off". Re-asserting
  -- on every replay would silently republish a link somebody had hidden. An
  -- existing profile therefore keeps whatever its owner last chose.
  "showGithub" boolean not null default false,
  "showLinkedin" boolean not null default false,
  -- Deterministic, so a replay finds the same row and so the headshot key in
  -- the `avatars` bucket -- which is the bare user id -- is knowable before
  -- the upload. That upload is `supabase/seed/avatars/<id>`, carried into the
  -- bucket by `objects_path` in config.toml, so `db reset` restores the images
  -- with the rows. The two halves are named by the same literal: rename an id
  -- here and the matching file has to move with it.
  --
  -- The exception is an officer who already has an account, since the profile
  -- then hangs off their real user id and the file named for "seededId" is not
  -- theirs. A reset cannot hit this -- it empties auth.users first -- but a
  -- seed replayed over a live database can, and the symptom is one card back
  -- to initials.

-- Officer titles as leadership roles
-- ============================================================
--
-- `isLeadership` is what the homepage selects on and what
-- `resolvedUserPermissions` reads for `isLeader` -- which is also the flag
-- that reveals the Role Description field on /account. Marking these roles
-- leadership is therefore what lets each officer edit the bio their own card
-- prints, which is the point.
--
-- Ranks are allocated above the current maximum rather than fixed: `rank` is

-- 'custom', so a hardcoded number would collide with whatever the console has
-- already created. No existing role is leadership, so appending still orders
-- the board correctly among the roles that matter. An existing role keeps its
-- rank and colour -- an officer may have reordered it since.

-- Separate from the block above because he sent no submission: there is no
-- resume, no headshot email and no bio in his own words. What is here was
-- confirmed directly -- the address, spring 2027, and the presidency -- plus a
-- bio drafted for him and accepted as a placeholder he intends to rewrite.
--
-- His bio uses no pronoun, so it needed no revision when pronouns arrived.
--
-- His headshot is the `apps/platform/src/assets/sloan.jpg` this branch deleted
-- along with the other placeholder headshots, recovered into the archive and
-- derived to `web/sloan-finger.webp` for the avatars bucket.
