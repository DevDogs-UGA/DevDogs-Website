-- Personas, and a worked example of a report against real content.
--
-- Without these a fresh instance has nothing to moderate: no member exists, so
-- there is nothing to report, and the console's moderation queue opens empty and
-- unexplained. Seeds only ever run on `supabase db reset`, which is pointed at a
-- local stack or a contributor's own throwaway project, never production.
--
-- ⚠️ THE CONTENT HERE IS REAL. An earlier version of this file seeded a
-- `sandbox` schema of fake posts and comments -- an entire fixture app,
-- registered in platform."apps" on every tier including production, denied there
-- by a restrictive policy. It is gone. What is reported below is
-- platform."profile", the same table the account settings page writes, so the
-- integration a contributor reads here is the one that actually ships.

-- ============================================================
-- Personas
-- ============================================================
--
-- Seeded rather than federated. A contributor can sign in as one of these with
-- email/password on any tier, including the local Docker stack, which is HTTP
-- and therefore cannot host OAuth at all.
--
-- Every one of them signs in with the password `password`. That is fine here
-- and nowhere else: seeds do not run on `db push`, so this file cannot reach a
-- database that was not deliberately erased first.
--
-- They exist mainly so a contributor can *encounter* a permission boundary.
-- You are always Root on your own instance, so clicking around never denies you
-- anything -- switching to `member@devdogs.test` is the only way to see what an
-- ordinary user sees.

-- The empty strings are not decoration. GoTrue scans confirmation_token,
-- recovery_token, email_change_token_new and email_change into non-nullable Go
-- strings, and those four columns have no database default, so a row inserted
-- without them exists but fails every sign-in with "Database error querying
-- schema" -- an error that names neither the column nor the user.

-- ============================================================
-- Report reasons -- deliberately absent
-- ============================================================
--
-- Reasons used to be seeded here, cross-joined onto every registered app: the
-- same eight rows copied once per app, which is what made it obvious they were
-- never per-app at all.
--
-- They are now a global vocabulary, created by
-- 20260807000000_platform_report_reasons_enum.sql. That matters beyond tidiness:
-- seeds run only on `db reset`, never on production, so seeding them meant a
-- fresh production instance had no reasons and could accept no reports until
-- somebody typed them into a dashboard page. Being in a migration is what makes
-- every tier agree.

-- ============================================================
-- One open report
-- ============================================================
--
-- Inserted directly rather than through platform.file_report(), which needs a
-- session. The RPC is the only supported way for an application to file one --
-- it is what fills "reportedUserId" and "contentSnapshot" from the content
-- itself so a client cannot falsify either. This row spells that out longhand
-- because a seed has no caller to attribute it to.
--
-- Left OPEN rather than pre-resolved, and that is the whole design of this
-- fixture. The interesting half of profile moderation is what resolving does --
-- the freeze, and the name reset -- and a seed that had already resolved it
-- would show a contributor the after state with no way to watch the transition.
-- Resolve it from /console/moderation as `moderator@devdogs.test`.
--
-- "contentRef" is the profile's primary key, which is the member's own
-- auth.users id. That is not a coincidence to be tidied away later: profile is
-- one row per user, so addressing the content and addressing the author are the
-- same question.
